# Astro Tailwindcss Starter

This Astro.build starter is setup to use Tailwindcss for styling with postcss import and nesting out of the box. Tailwind config is included and should be modified per project. CSS can be found in `src/css` (this includes a base line default for some typography and buttons).

Alpine is included as well via CDN. If you do not need Alpine, remove the script tags in `src/components/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`. I know this kinda defeats the point of Astro, but it's just easier than some of the frameworks and light enough to really not matter. ⚖️

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
